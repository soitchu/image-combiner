## What does it do?
It grabs `n`<sup>2</sup> number of pictures and "combines" them pixel by pixel. For example, if you combine 9 images together, and grab 3x3 pixels from the final generated image, each of those 9 pixels will belong to a different image. So, translating them by 0-2 pixels horizontally, and 0-2 pixels vertically will make the brower show a different image.

**Note: This does not work on firefox.**
