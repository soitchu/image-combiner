## What does it do?
It grabs `n`<sup>2</sup> number of pictures and "combines" them pixel by pixel. For example, an image is added by assigning every 3rd horizontal and vertial pixel of the final image to that canvas. So, when it is scaled down by `1/n`, only one of the images is shown. And when it is translated by a pixel, another image is shown and so on.

**Note: This does not work on firefox.**
